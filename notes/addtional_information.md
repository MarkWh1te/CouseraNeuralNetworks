## Probability and Information Theory
# Probability theory is a mathematical framework for representing uncertain statements.
## the three source of uncertain

1. Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled
2. Incomplete observability
3. Incomplete modeling


# Information theory allows us to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a probability distribution
